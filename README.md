# Blockchain data-structure implementation

# Description

This my rather basic implementation of the blockchain data-structure. I created a BlockChain class which has a list of Blocks. Also implemented the idea of PoW(Proof of Work).

# Features

- Implemented Block class
- Implemented BlockChain class
- Choosable difficulty for mining (Proof of Work)

## Run Locally

##### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Visual Studio to run ASP .NET backend

Clone the project and navigate to the project folder

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vmarcell96/BlockChain
  cd .\BlockChain
  Open BlockChain.sln
  Press Ctrl+F5 for starting the application
```

## Roadmap

- Imlementing Merkle tree
- GUI
